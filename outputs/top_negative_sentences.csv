My unit was manufactured on 12/13 uses the latest UL 1449 3rd Edition specs for performance and safety and I confirmed most during the disassembly
Quality control certificates for each specific serial numbered unit showing each was tested before leaving the factory; most makers only sample test a few per lot, not each unit
The newer designs have the SPD portion in its own 'blast' box, so any debris that occurs during a severe surge are contained in the blast box
Similarly, the screws and mount holes are also separately boxed, to insure it doesn't touch any power lines inside the SPD
The roof of the main blast box has a fire retardant to contain flames, which is a common occurrence is severe surges with MOV protection
The MOV are now wired to kill the main power in case of a LN surge, and the ground line in case of a LG or NG surge, and a third fail safe fuse to kill main power as a backup to the above; the net result is a bad surge will kill the whole unit

screen is easy to read, even in bright sunlight
lack of CD player makes the unit small and lightweight - easier to handle during install, and less moving parts to fail
easy install, just like any standard stereo
simple, un-flashy design
actual volume knob which reacts quickly
reads SD cards fast, changes tracks fast too
play/pause, next and back buttons will also control phone via bluetooth
phone automatically links almost immediately after starting the car (once it's paired of course)

The Bad:
faceplate feels a little cheap and sometimes hard to snap back on
buttons sometimes rattle
needs more treble - highs are weak
text is hard to read on screen for track info because it has so few characters and scrolls too quick
directory sorting is moronic
USB doesn't seem to work at all (maybe mine's defective)
manual is a poorly translated mess which doesn't really help you understand functions
Boss doesn't seem to know their own products - some places (including the box!!) say it has a CD player, and there's even a Laser warning sticker on the chassis, even though there's obviously no laser inside
