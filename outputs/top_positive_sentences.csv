1- IPS with great viewing angles and accurate colors and excellent image, right out of the box easy setup with default setting just a mazing clarity and quality, just make sure to connect the DVI or HDMI to get the full potential of this monitor, the anti glare works great the window is behind me and I do not see any reflections, text is very sharp, images is just clean
2- light weight and thin does not take much room on the desk
3- 23"" is a bout the right screen size not too big and certainly not small, to me just perfect size
4- has VGA, HDMI, DVI connections placed at the right place easy to access also the VGA and DVI cables are included

Records in 60p or compressed MP4
-crisp / clear video
-good colors
-can zoom in on your saved video and see the details clearly
Uses an SD card for storage (none provided - you need to purchase)
Zoom works nicely
-not too fast when zooming, zooms ""smoothly"" at a nice pace/speed
-doesnt produce a ""jerk"" effect when starting zoom (appears smooth & natural)
Very easy to use
-pretty much turn on record and point and shoot
-auto focuses for you (works well)

much better than Sony CX380, CX290 video quality wise

I owned two Sony camcorders CX380 and CX290 and returned both - the reason was the colors were too bright (settings wouldnt fix), BOTH had a fish eye lens effect on both sides of the video (left and right side top to bottom) - you can see my other reviews on the two Sony camcorders I mentioned

B&H $199 no tax free shipping

To go with this I recommend: PNY Elite Performance 64GB UHS-1 SDXC Flash Card (P-SDX64U1H-GE-A) (90MB/sec) works GREAT

0.9966,"I read all over the place when deciding what to do for sound in my livingroom - here is what I have to say after pulling the trigger, and that people debating buying should consider:

- It uses the TV as a receiver - you cannot run it with a typical home theater receiver i don't think - this fine for me and intended
- Its undeniably expensive (I bought refurbished for $530)
- Audiophiles probably would maybe say its not great sound - I'm not one of those and i think it sounds great
- According to other reviews It probably sounds much better with the super expensive $700 bass - i'm waiting for a price drop to maybe buy that
- I bought a nice new thin TV with s***ty sound that has great picture and looks good mounted on wall - didn't want to have some massive wired sound system cluttering up the living room
- This looks great resting on hearth under TV - nice and minimalist
- it doesnt have all sorts of wires to run everywhere - just TV to Sonos
- The Sonos phone app is pretty cool
1) its intuitive
2) it makes setting up the speaker very easy
3) It shows a quick easy menu to do everything like:
play pandora
play iheartradio
play podcasts that are on your phone
play music thats on your phone
play radio stations with ""tunein""
- It does NOT work with my 2015 model year higher end Samsung TV remote - got the blu ray player remote to control it for now but need to figure out how to make the TV remote work
- Its great to have to just play music from when not watching TV, and use your phone in a very quick and convenient way to do so
- If you live in an apartment or might be moving and want a nice loud awesome speaker, definitely consider this over a full wired sound system as its super easy to move (could even bring it to a friends for a party or whatever)",5.0,17

 - magnetic flap closure for box a nice touch

Construction
 - metal construction

 - buttons show some ""wiggle"" but do not feel too loose
 - usb-c Jack a nice touch as it prevents damage to port by forcing plug in incorrectly as can  happen with micro USB
 - band and ear-cup material of good quality with ample padding

Comfort
 - easily adjusted to a snug comfortable fit
 - for me these are over ear headphones but fit may be different for those with larger head or ears
 - padding very comfortable and did not get too hot with extended use

Ease of Use
 - paired easily and on first try (tested on several devices)
 - buttons in easy to reach positions and provide good tactile feedback
 - charging worked as expected and was able to change from laptop and generic USB charger without problems

Bluetooth Quality
 - as noted earlier pairing was quick and easy on devices running IOS, Mac Os, Windows 10 and android

0.9959,"I am a BlackBerry fan since many years ago, so I might not be the most objective person reviewing this phone, but I'll try to do my best

First I have to say, the BlackBerry 10 is definitely a great operation system; after a little practice you'll master the gestures or movement to manage the system; is fluent, stable, and very practical

The highlights are (at least for me):

-The peek motion to see if you receive a message, mail, notification or update without leaving your current application (like video, calendar, web page, etc.)

-The time shift on the camera; that lets you take a really fast set of continuous photos and with a simple slide of your finger, you can select the best/sharpest one, then go to the face of the person on the photo and select the one in which the person is with their eyes open and/or smiling and the phone will combine both photos into one automatically (no other smartphone has this feature, that I know)

-The keyboard; well I don't know how to explain how easy is to use this keyboard, large keys, soft to the touch, and the phone predict the next possible words that you may write, so you only have to tap on the correct one, and it also have and auto correctors that is state of the art

-The bowser has a unique feature, which converts most of the web pages you'll visit in to a readable document, like in a kindle with only the text (with font size adjustment) so you'll have a more comfortable reading experience

-The phone is built to last; but any ways I'll recommend that you use a cover for more protection ; )
The only con that I can list is that the apps available is not that big as the ones for Android and IPhone; however, this is expected to change since BlackBerry release a conversion package so developers can transform Android App to BlackBerry quick easily; so the most popular app from Android should arrive to BlackBerry sometime soon

Note: you can install some android apps, just search in the web for more information of how to do it; but is a little complicated for a regular user, so I really don't recommended

So basically, this is a great smartphone, and if you like physically keyboard this one has no competition!!!",5.0,10
0.9957,"Pros: Works great, sensitive receiver which gets signal inside my house where my Nuvi won't, good battery life, interface is easy to understand and logical, tough enough to survive mounting on a snowmobile (Garmin might not recommend it but that's how I use it)

cons: be aware that to make unit useful you will have to add at least one map at about $80 as whether you are on or off road the local roads are probably your best location reference and these are not on the included basemap so you will want to add either the Topo or road map (both include local streets but only the street map has data for turn by turn routing on roads) also the included microsd card is laughably small, add a 2 GB microSD card which is less than $10 at Amazon, saves 20 tracks at 500 points each (the current track can have up to 10,000 points and those can be saved on the SD card but the saved tracks get cut down to 500 points though they seem to maintain good accuracy) where Garmins new units can save 20 at 10,000 points each, not really a big problem but if you want to save the tinyest details of large tracks it might matter to you

Not really a con but for a bit more you can get the latest and greatest from Garmin which has a big beautiful display and works well also, if you want a newer unit and are into cold weather sports like me consider the Colorado over the Oregon as I have read that the touch screen on the Oregon doesn't work well in the cold, I've used the Colorado and it works great as well",5.0,0
0.9954,these 'cans' as we say in radio -- are more like ear muffs on a cool winter day -- they are to WARM and the material causing sweating the material is simply too uncomfortable -- also over-the-head band is too constricting -- pushing into the ears muffs sideways --  perhaps to keep out ambient noise out -- BUT NOT COMFORTABLE -- or perhaps its the weight of the earphones ---  finally the bass is too much - but maybe some folks like a super bass -- i was looking for a headphone set that would emphasize vocals - as that i wanted to use them for audio academic lecture primarily -- the $15 was a great buy AND the white style is kinda kewl looking ( i guess if your  podcasting or webcasting skype lol ) but the model RP-HT21 panasonic is ' 5 ' fantastic at amazing ~ $3.82 -- 75% cheaper than sony -- i plan to actaully order another set of the panasonic -- whoops forgot in fairness the sony are swivel is a great feature as that the earphones can lie ' flat' on a desk / table surface -- IF i purchased these sony locally store rather than online >> the sony would be returned - BTW amazon did a great job on the fast AND free shipping minimum $25 purchase -- kudos amazon -:),2.0,0
0.9954,"These cables are great these are made very well they are the perfect length and the sound that comes through them is also wonderful, I am super happy with this and I'm sure you will be also, the kids has taken these from me they are using them for everything and love them as well, I would suggest and reccomend these to anyone and I'm sure you will be just as happy with this as we are, give them a try you won't be sorry you done so

I did get this item at a discounted price or free in exchange for a fair and honest review, I am not affaliated with this company or product at all, I am simply a person who reads reviews in making my buying decisions and hopefully this will help in your buying decisions, thanks again for taking the time to read this review and have a great rest of your day !!",5.0,0
0.9954,"i had only a previous experience with sennheiser headphones, and it was with a couple of IEM, i was happy with those but a family member lost them, now with this pair of headphones its by far the best headphones i have ever owned on almost every aspect, definitely my favorites, i previously had a pair of M-audio studiophile Q40, they broke because of the plastic parts, i was very satisfied with the sound of those, which are supposed to have a flat response unlike the sennheiser momentum on-ear, not that the sennheiser doesnt sound amazing, but i knew my next pair of headphones will have to be sturdier, less plastic parts, and then i saw this pair of headphones at 99 Dls, check the reviews and took a chance on these headphones, let me start by saying these are not expensive, a lot of on-ear headphones might cost less money, but you are paying for quality, and this headphones have everything, great design, materials, build quality, light weight, sound quality, look gorgeous and have a couple of propietary cables one for plain listenning and other for smartphone with the convenience of the phone buttons, now let me talk about the sound of the headphones, if you have tried diffrent types of headphones design, In-Ear, on-ear, over the ear, open closed headphones, you might have an idea of what to expect from this pair of headphones which enter the category of, on ear closed headphones, the sound signature is not flat, they are closed which reduced the soundstage, the bass is better than what you would expect for the size and weight, it surprised me, the highs also seem enhanced but the mids are still very well represented, vocals sound pretty good and unlike many headphones, you can notice there is a good separation of the instruments, highs and lows and vocals doesnt mix up, the sound signature of the headphones is very fun to listen to, specially with radiohead, gorillaz, daft punk, john coltrane, amelie soundtrack, pulp fiction soundtrack, arctic monkeys, the vaccines, the killers, the strokes, cranberries, chvrches, lana del rey, dido, sarah mclachlan, sheryl crow, etc; i have been trowing flacs to this pair of headphones over the last 4 days, and they just keep impressing me, the sound isolation is good from outside noises, however other people might be able to listen what you are playing, if you are wearing glases be aware, in my case they start hurting my ears after 3 hours, but is the clamping force which makes for the sound isolation and improves the bass, overall im very satisfied with this headphones, they are stylish and sound amazing",5.0,5

-Small and stylish will be sure to turn heads

-Strong metal body so that it won't break should you hit it against a wall or drop it

-EASILY fits into your pocket

-The 2.5"" screen is gorgeous and the size is just right (it can get super bright should you need it to)

-Software couldn't be easier to use (it'll even rotate your pictures that are vertical automatically in the browser, and you can set it to save these rotations)

-The gimmicky extra modes are super cool (color accent to make everything b&w except for one color, color swap, positive film, etc)

-Surprisingly little noise at ISO 100 and ISO 200 (at least in the instances where I've used them)

-Very simplistic navigation on the camera with very few buttons to confuse you and nice little pictures on them

-The panoramic picture mode makes taking wide shots really easy

-It can go pretty fast, which means that you won't miss the moment you really want to capture (especially if you hold down the shutter button halfway to focus it ahead of time)

-It comes with an A/V cable right in the box, which is better than what most cameras tend to provide, and the slideshows that are built-in for you to show family and friends is real nifty

-Pretty much perfect for the point-and-shoot photographer who wants something ultra portable

-When you rotate the camera in playback, it'll rotate your picture view as well!",4.0,57

0.9951,"this is my first review and proud to say VISTA SALES1 did great i placed the order on the 11th and said it would be shipped between the 12th-13th and they shipped it out the the 12th and delivery estimate was 16th-3rd but it arrived on the 16th so from CA to NJ great delivery time and price so i'm giving VISTA SALES1 a 4 out of 5 stars only because of the product description it lacked the fact that it is compatible with all docking ipods and not i quote ""Compatible with any iPod with a dock connector--including the iPod nano 1G, iPod nano 2G, iPod mini, iPod 3G, iPod 4G (Click Wheel), iPod color, and iPod 5G/5.5G Video""
and i even e-mailed VISTA SALES1 twice but wasn't able to give the info i was asking for and that's if it works with the 120gb classic because i've seen it referred as a 6 generation video so i end up typing the product in google and found that it works for all docking ipods and it does it works very wonderfully very easy to use just read the manual just once and you know all the ins and outs of it but overall i love it the reason i got the Kensington 33169 Digital FM Radio and Transmitter for iPods is because i like listening to wendy williams experience on 107.5fm wbls so i always wanted an ipod but i knew it didn't have a fm radio (which is a flaw in ipods) but i really like the classic because of it's capacity so i planed to get a fm tuner so i can listen to wendy on the go and a bonus it's a fm transmitter so no wires in the car which is great so thank you VISTA SALES1 and AMAZON for making my new ipod classic 120gb almost complete (waiting for a shade)",5.0,0
0.995,"But u have to think twice if u are really going to need it or not
It took me half hour to have it matched and to have my Bx-10x epicenter to light
Only concern is tht I used a 7-10rms 2ch amp which it just..rrr *******
Okay..too much words lol XD
But if u have a better amp to run onto ur mids&highs then u are in good shape (:
When I hook up mine onto my jensen Vm9312 it sounded like if I wus live at the concert lol XD
Really clear sound u get out of it (:
Plus its a 7volt rms
Believe me..thts a true rms voltage
Songs with softly bass it justt increases the bass
And ma epicenter doing effect of shaking tht woofer like mutha****** (;
Somehow I took it off cuz I didn't like the way it sounded with tht lil amp tht keep on clipping ma mids&highs :(
Too bad I wasn't in need of it yet :(
Somehow I dnt role with equalizers since every stereo I have owned have had a big Eq setting and have sounded like if I wus using this Eq when I actully not using it lol
I'm not saying tht is not a good eq..It is a very great Eq but it would be better if u hook it into a stereo tht doesn't have enough equalizer settings or a stock stereo
Upgrading to better speakers makes a difference also
Mine are 2 5"" hifonics zeus 110rms (huge magnet btw)
I haved them for 3yrs now.",5.0,0

0.9947,"The auto focus is really great and so are the auto-exposure modes (I was previously an ALL-MANUAL guy.)

Laundry list of things I like:

Manual or auto-focus

Manual or multiple auto exposure modes

Depth of field preview

Delay timer for tripod work without cable release (or remote control)

Uses all Pentax K-mount lenses including my old M-series and A-series lenses that I love

Wonderfully ergonomic -- all the buttons where you want them, great grip (for right-handers)

Fast continuous shooting mode

Easy to use and logical menus and functions (I've only rarely needed to consult the manual)

Display screen is wonderfully large, bright, and clear; and you can zoom (to 12X) and pan the images -- so you can really make a good judgment about deleting an image

Viewfinder is bright and clear, seems to be about 95% of final image

I love the 18-55 zoom and 50-200 zoom lenses (I still want the 14mm)

Download is fast and simple

Everything is small and lightweight

I put Li-I batteries into the camera last August and they still read as fully-charged (this is after ballpark 2000 photos, 20+ downloads, and hundreds of flashes -- amazing!)

I get all the flexibility I want AND my techno-phobic wife can easily use it (!!!)

The only feature I've even considered that it doesn't have is mirror lock-up.",5.0,6

0.9947,"The 6490 3 way acoustic supsension speaker's frequency response ranges from 45-23,000 Hz which is accomplished thru the use of its 3 way acoustic suspension designed main 8 inch woofer audio driver, its secondary 4 inch mid range audio driver and its 7/8 inch quality audio sound balanced ferro-fluid dome tweeter;

the 8 inch main woofer audio driver has a contrasting flexible high compliance pearl whit colored high excursion long throw cone woofer audio driver with a cloth surround and also an inverted dust cover with silver colored trim ring, the mid range audio driver is a 4 inch ferro fluid cooled pearlized white coated cone type with inverted dust cover with silver colored trim ring; the 7/8 inch balanced dome tweeter is also ferro fluid cooled audio tweeter driver with silver colored trim ring;

the speakers audio drivers are magnetically shielded with gold plated banana plug compatible audio terminal jacks in the back of speaker; the black satin audio grilled cloth is acoustically transparent to cover the front of speaker while helping to protect it from any potential dust pollution in ones listening space;

the audio speakers are rated as a standard 8 ohm audio speaker for use in connecting to ones audio stereo and/or ones 5.1 a/v receiver application; the 6490 3 way acoustic suspension audio speakers are priced as a left/ right audio pair perfect for any standard audio stereo speaker L/R pairing;

they also do not come with any audio speaker wire included; the speaker cabinet is constructed of what is  typically called in the audio speaker construction industry as standard MDF(medium denisty fiberboard) a very sturdy and rigid reinforced high density particle board composite material used in construction of audio speakers;

my previous set of audio speakers were four 2 way KLH model 911 audio speakers with 4.5 inch woofers audio driver with 1/2 inch tweeter audio driver; they were adequate to provide sufficient speaker volume but the 6490 audio speaker sounds much more airy, spacious, full, clear, crisp, detailed, and definitely more open audio speaker characteristic wise quite a bit more pleasant to listen to both audio movies and music content; overall much better than the old 2 way KLH model 911's previous set of four speakers;

another tip and/or technique that I use in order to actually get a much more substantial actual audio bass response from the Yamaha 3 Way Bookshelf Speakers; when used in the already above stated audio configuration is I adjust the Behringer 302 Sound Mixer by sliding its L/R audio input line level volume control knob all the way up while also at the same time sliding/adjusting the L/R audio input low frequency adjustment slider control all the way up to its maximum +15dB slider position; while also at the same time sliding/adjusting the L/R audio input high frequency adjustment slider control all the way down to its -15dB slider position;

this has the very unusually nice audio special effect of introducing and getting much more potentially desirable needed appropriate L/R audio input line levels; now by deliberately over amplifying the above stated audio input L/R audio low line level audio inputs for specifically the low frequencies by +15dB and then also deliberately over attenuating the above stated audio input L/R audio low line level audio inputs for specifically the high frequencies for -15dB also as well;

this directly results in actually getting of course a much more substantially enhanced enjoyable listenable highly desirable actual audio bass response being output from the Yamaha 3 Way Bookshelf Speakers; once the resulting above stated desired appropriately customized audio input L/R audio low line level audio outputs from the Behringer model 302 Sound Mixer are actually fed directly into the accompanying already connected Yamaha RS-201 Stereo receiver's L/R audio low line level audio dual RCA input jacks themselves;

now for those do it yourself audio 3 way upgrade speaker hobbyists this relatively inexpensive pair of speakers makes for a great upgrade project indeed; as the yamaha website speaker data shows the audio crossover frequencies are at 2,500hz and 8,000hz; so it should be fairly easy to plug in a completely pre assembled and completely pre populated printed circuit board crossover and just connect ones audio woofer driver, ones audio mid range driver and ones audio tweeter driver up with relative easy and no muss or fuss at all;

the audio crossover frequency between woofer and midrange audio drivers is 2,500hz and the audio crossover frequency between the mid range and tweeter drivers is 8,000hz.",5.0,5

0.9945,"PROS
*2.1, and the .1 makes a huge difference
*Very compact, ideal for a computer setup
*Easy setup and connectivity, pair once and then you are good to go every time after
*Sleek looking satellite speakers
*AUX input for those who want to enjoy these speakers with older systems or non-Bluetooth devices
*8 watts RMS power total (2 Watts per satellite, 4 Watts for the subwoofer) - the speakers can get pretty loud if you want to rock out but 8W for a computer setup is plenty
*Nice informative instruction manual, doesn't just tell you how to setup the speakers but also gives you tips for making your system sound better
*Nicely packaged and boxed up - doesn't just arrive in a cardboard box, this is a product that was also meant to be marketed on the shelves
*Sounds pretty good, the bass nicely rounds out the system and the ported sub works great
*Very nice volume dial, could set multiple levels at a really low volume which is perfect for listening to music while working in the vicinity of others
*Headphone output jack on front

CONS
*The Bluetooth Blue LED is very bright and stays on once connected to Bluetooth.",5.0,15
0.9945,"Pros:
Great size, very thin and pretty lightweight
Easy to assemble the platform
Picture quality is OK once you tweak it to your likings
Sound quality is OK once tweaking that as well (turn off the AVL bc it just creates background noise)
Have not tried the HDMI ports, but the USB works fine
Came with all needed components and nothing was damaged
It swivels enough to adjust to the angle you want
No glare problem
Cheap but not low quality

Cons:
Takes some adjusting to get the picture/sound you want
Still, the picture is not as vibrant as shown on the box or on here; looks like your average tv but the HD channels are better and Amazon video/Netflix HD and super HD is nice
Cannot program tv to Comcast cable remote; unknown brand so you have to use the tv remote for power/volume

Tips:
*Turn off the AVL, because it just creates background noise (Thanks Amazon tech support)
**I set my picture to these settings: 30 brightness, 80 contrast, 50 color, 0 tint, 50 sharpness, turned off dynamic contrast and chose the warm color temperature
***To assemble, I placed the screen on my satin pillowcase to avoid scratching, but oils from my hair that were on my pillowcase created a lot of smudges on the screen.",4.0,6

Everything works just like it should and the ez setup was outstanding
If you have a sony tv it works seamlessly at this price point and 46 inch bar wireless subwoofer there's nothing else to think about unless you want to spend over 500.00 and even at that it will be hard to match
I have it set up in a big family room and it sounds big my wife though I was crazy to replace our older system but speakers were everywhere now we have a clean look and better sound oh and bluetooth sounds great just tap you phone on the bar
Sony thought of everything  and I looked hard to find all these features but nothing came close in price
I don't understand why people say it's great for small rooms it's a 46 inch bar with big sound

0.9943,"Warts aside the camera has had some significant firmware updates, and retains the same X-Trans CMOS sensor that the X-Pro 1 has, even though there are newer models the image quality is virtually identical between all the cameras (at least in raw)

My summary of stronger and weaker aspects of the camera having shot with one for a few weeks now

Good points:

+ Solid build, partial magnesium alloy it's not quite as beefy as the X-Pro 1 but a step up in build v the entry models
+ Good high resolution EVF 2.3 million dot OLED
+ Excellent sensor, good details and dynamic range lots of latitude for raw processing at both ends
+ Very good jpeg processing (in fact much nicer than the newer models) contrast isn't too high, dynamic range is very decent and it doesn't suffer from the aggressive noise reduction new models do
+ Great low light performance (though Fuji are overstating the actual ISO somewhat)
+ Easy to use and mostly intuitive operation Q Menu is very useful and makes most settings within easy reach
+ Some useful features like panoramic sweep, electronic level, option to store up to 7 custom settings
+ AF + MF allows you to manual focus after autofocus (with latest firmware update)
+ Focus peak feature useful for manual focus or using non Fuji lenses with an adapter, 2 levels of magnification
+ Metering and Auto White Balance are mostly on target, appealing tonality and look to images (very subjective but many do like the Fuji look)
+ Traditional range finder feel in both handling and style, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation give a more hands on experience, two buttons can be user set to specific functions

Weaker aspects:

- EVF lags in lower light conditions (quite a bit)
- Rear LCD is a perfectly usable 460k 2.8 panel but it's not up to the newer displays nothing stand out here
- No way to remove the EV compensation on the EVF display (cuts into the image on the left hand side)
- Continuous autofocus isn't great, central AF point only not really suitable for action or moving subjects (at least not moving quickly)
- 2.5mm microphone socket the whole world uses 3.5mm and Fuji picks a non standard size (you can buy an adapter for it)
- No shutter speed setting on the dial for the 1/180 sec flash sync speed.",4.0,5

I Mostly use the double glass and the f-stop 4-8 or so occasionally using the f/2- I don't bother with the smaller f-stops like f-22-16 as I'm not as crazy about the look of shots at those smaller f-stops- it approaches regular lens look by those f-stops in my opinion- I want the soft, cool colors you get with the larger f-stops",4.0,0

0.9936,"I use to have one that looked exactly like this that I bought at Radio Shack but I do not think they carry it anymore, years ago I used one like this but in order for it to work the best in my opinion you have to use a gel wrist pad with it, due to your arms resting on the gel wrist pad and facing down it is a way more comfortable position than typing on a regular keyboard, laptop or anything for that matter, I use a laptop now and just hate it because it is so awkward, once you had the best you don't want the rest I guess, I like to get the ones with the numbers like this one, for an even better experience I had a logitech marble mouse with the ball so I never had to use my wrist, if you are on the computer a whole hell of a lot I would consider getting all the things I suggested and the gel mouse pad for added comfort, it makes you never want to leave your computer and never getting tired, desk low enough to be comfortable, resting on a gel, typing down, and twirling your fingers around in one spot using thumb for clicking and resting on gel, dream come true ;-) , out of all the ones I have looked at this one seems to be the best and most like the one I had so I think I am going to buy this one, I cannot stop dreaming about my experiences with the soft to the touch silicone keyboard, not only is it quiet but you barely touch the keys which is also easier on the fingers, no carpel tunnel using all that hehe.",5.0,0

0.9936,"Cons:
-didn't come with those handy cable management brackets/U-hooks that come with most racks
-although sturdy it wouldn't take much to break in to (see other thoughts)
-shipping did inflict a couple MINOR indententations (less than what I would consider a dent)

Other Thoughts:
-The reason this is the cheapest rack in its class is because you are sacrificing steel for money, (you get what you pay for right?) but the overall design is top-notch so definitely a favorable trade-off
-although a 10 year old could break into this thing because the doors/walls are thin, whats important to me is you will know if someone has tampered with it (kinda a plus to having tender walls lol)
-I didn't end up using the casters but they are heavy-duty and look good, actually used some uni-strut to mount it at waste height for ease of access
-Cable management for wiring in a 24 bundle of cat6 is perfect, you could pull off 48 but would probably have to use both top and bottom access's to keep it clean

All in all VERY pleased with this rack, a friend of mine experienced in hardware installs came down to help do the job and he was more excited about it than I was.",5.0,4
0.9935,"- but I settled for the Denon as I got a better price - not sure what the sound difference is, as I did not have a side by side comparison, but I absolutely love the Denon AVR 990 Phono Input stage, with my JVC QL-Y55F - with GRADO G-2 Cartridge - sounds MUCH better than my CD's that I have the same Copy on both, It is a fun test for when people that come over to see how suspired the Vinyl records sound fuller and richer than CD's  - also my speakers are also my speakers are Magnepans (full-range ribbon) - that helps

Anyway - the sound is Amazing, and I am very happy with my purchase, as my Previous model for the last 6 years was Harman Kardon - so I wanted to make sure the new model sounded as good or better than my last - as you may have noticed, I felt not go back to Harman Kardon - not because I did not like sound or quality!",5.0,7
0.9935,"Be aware, that at 17mm and F/4, the extreme corners of image are really not very nice- real mushy- but by 5.6 they are pretty good- they also get better at F/4 by around 20mm, 22mm soimwhere in there if you're itnent on shooting at F/4- Just steer clear of 17mm at F/4 unless soft corners is what you intend

If you can't decide between this lens or the 16-35 2.8 - perhaps deciding what you shoot most woudl help- IF you shoot mostly landscapes on tripod- with mirror lockup and all that- and only occasionally take portraits outside or architecture outside in ok light, then really, you don't need a fast lens and htis lens will save you a substantial bit of money over the 16-35- Also, IF you have a canon 5d111 or the 1DX, then you can crank up the iso indoors withou much worry at all, and htis lens is perfectly adequate for indoor shots in lowish light- However, IF you don't like using higher iso's, and you have plenty of money, and mostly take portraits or family hsots indoors, or basketball games or whathaveyou- then the 16-35 might be a better lens for you- As well, I've heard that the difference in wide angle from 17- 16 is pretty significant difference, not sure how much though- so that might be a consideration too-

And folks, remember, todays lenses are leaps and bounds more sophisticated and clear and sharp than many of the old lenses that photographers/artists had to work with in times past- We keep looking for comparisons between todays razor sharp lenses, and worry abotu slight softness or chromatic abberations or whatever, but really, I think if we compared today's lenses with thsoe used by artists decades ago, we'd fidn that we're pretty lucky today to have such high quality lenses at prices we can somewhat afford",4.0,10
0.9934,i have been using this lens for a little while and its mix reaction let me make clear i am not a pro or advance photographer but average Joe i am speaking in plain language it takes a beautiful pictures and not so beautiful pictures i am taking about sharpness some pictures are very sharp and great looking and some feel like they are out focus or fuzzy just a little bit i was planing to use this lens at wedding of my cousin thats why i bought this lens but i think i am going to use Nikon 18-55 just to be safe and use this only if i need it on camera LCD Display it looks fine but when you see in computer thats when you see very clearly and this is not an issue all the time but its their i just take lots of pictures so in case pictures that you want is not so clear you have many choices to chose from would i recommend this lens that depends on your budget if you can't spend lots of money on lens like me and you have budget of 350 to 375 this is a very good lens Nikon 18-200 is 950 and this is around 360 which is little more then 1/3 the price but its not 1/3 the quality i don't have Nikon 18-200 but i have seen picture posted by users on amazon and they look very good this lens takes very good pictures most of time it some pictures i am not happy with focus wise they feel soft then again Nikon lens user may get those pictures but they are not going to post them on amazon but you have to have 18-200 lens and don't have money to buy Nikon or canon i would definitely recommend this lens,3.0,0

+ Appearance; these are really great looking headphones
+ Comfort; the headband adjusts to fit my very large head quite nicely and the earpads are comfortable enough for hours of use

0.9931,"Although its not dual 4ohms, it is actually dual 8ohms, but when you connect both voice coils in series it turns into 4ohms, if it were dual 4ohms, then you would be dropping the resistence to 2ohms when you connect both voice coils in series, in turn it would be more powerful, but you would also need a much more expensive amp, and it's the opposite when you connect them in parallel, but anyways, I've been watching the Bazooka brand for many years, they have been progressing from good to better, and always a good value, as huge as this tube is I had to put it on the floor of my Chrysler Aspen, in between the second and third row, with about 6"" clearance from the cone to the wall, the results are that I can not fold my third row completely, but even though bass is very impressively loud, I'm gonna eventually take it out, becouse for what I use the vehicle is for family, and besides it came with a alpine system that is outstanding, so eventually I'm gonna put the tube, and a bandpass box with a punch woofer in hatchback, just for me to drive from work and school, by myself, so I won't hurt any of my familys ears lol, whenever I can save up some dough for the hatchback, hehehe.....",5.0,0
0.993,"HereOne may have a slight edge in fit, but the verves have never fallen out of my ear
-- sound reproduction is good, an audiophile might say the hereones are a bit better but practically not much difference
-- they pair easily and reliably with my iPhone 6plus with very little dropping
-- battery life is good, probably better than the hereones, and each time they pair you get an audio estimate of remaining play time
-- I've had no trouble placing phone calls with them

The Not So Good:
-- no active noise cancellation, so in noisy environments there is a dramatic difference between the terrific active adjustable noise cancellation of the hereones and the purely passive noise reduction of the verves
-- on my iphone 6plus phone calls are only heard through the left earbud which is both somewhat bizarre and irritating
-- there's no easy way to see how much juice is left in the case unlike the hearone case
-- unlike the hearone, where both buds connect separately to the phone, the verve has one master bud (the left one) and a slave one (the right one), not a big deal for the casual user but it does mean the right bud is useless without the left one being active
-- the verve app is pretty crummy (like many headphone apps are), a stark contrast to the well engineered hereone app

Overall, I like the verves and I think they are a good value for the money, but not in the same class as premium wireless buds like the hereone.",4.0,0

The X20 came well packaged in a distinctive black box, and from the moment it was opened and taken out, the feel of a solid, precision camera was quite apparent.",5.0,217
0.993,"this small device really turn my family time happier, I bought this device from ebay with less than 100$ and we were able to do all the fun with it, you can play like wii using the air mouse and you can have all the advanced applications and smart phones right on your TV

my TV is Panasonic viera Plasma TV 42"", I am not sure if that would be similar to other LED or LCD or even Plasma TVs but mine dose not support the enough power to operate the MK802IIIS, as it need 2000mAh while the TV sound like <=500mAh, so I had to buy an external USB adapter with 2000mAh or more so i got one with 2.1A = 2100mAh, but actually a USB mobile charger with more than 700mAh could operate the MK802IIIS but you should expect to shutdown any minute if you over load the processor

the problem is the processor is designed to do much more than you could touch in any smart phone or tablet, and for that it need power, so when i connect the USB DC port to me TV and launch the google play to download few apps quickly, while it is downloading and instead of waiting i launch the browser and TICK TUCK it shut down, not restarting but shut down

so read some forums and figure out the power problem, so i used my phone charger which is blackberry with 850mAh it operate the device successfully and play games for hours with my kids and no shutdown happen, but for some reason it still shutdown if you kept many apps opened at the same time, because my child will always click on home instead of back to select the next game, so by selecting home the app does not terminated, but still inactive in the back

so i got the 2100mAh USB adapter and all good, you can hit to reach the maximum processor limit of 1.6 MHz and you feel like flying

using wifi or bluetooth, the speed is super, and the additional Rikomagic application which you can download from the play store on your android phone will allow you to do the punch and zoom same like the smart phone touch screen

one more notice: it is not easy to find a camera device to connect to the MK802IIIS you need to find compatible camera in order to use SKYPE which make my wife life much easy talking to family abroad instead of her samsung mobile,

So Games, Skype, Facebook, Youtube, and Citrix receiver for business, with the right power adapter all the family can enjoy their time infornt of the TV, sound smart TV right?",5.0,0

-Long lasting (good battery)
-Plays more formats (especially FLAC support is rare)
Supports both UMS and MTP modes (for those people with DRM infested WMAs)
-Has improved quality with firmware upgrades [...]
-Great quality output -- both noise level and quality level
-Looks pretty good (my previous El-Cheapo brand DAP looked like a toy boat for a kid to play with in the water -- this player looks as stylish as any iPod)
-Nice color screen with lots of detail (you can set wallpapers and watch little videos, so this is a definite pro)

The card preforms great , i can't complain , the speed is better than the popular brand's , you can't beat it , it is absolutely superb , again im amazed , Pixel Flash has set new and greater heights  other companies should learn from them(Pixel Flash)and there  achievement's , as a photographer i want the best , it is absolutely necessary for my work , i have yet to find anything wrong with Pixel Flash

0.9916,"with the 3 front speakers and sub playing, it sounds better than any pc speaker setup i have ever heard, even some very pricey ones like the logitech 5500, and creative gigaworks (5.1)i would have liked a little more sound from the tweeters, but most amps can add treble to suit your liking....i have tried alot of music at various levels, and for the price the system is VERY good....my aperion 6 series speakers sounds way better than these onkyos, but then the aperions cost me $3500, so its not fair to compare to those, for the price i think they are great, i tried the klipsh 300HD system as well they cost around 330$ and sounded marginally better with some music, but they didn't sound 140$ worth better, unless you want smaller speakers

movies sounds pretty good too, the sub is able to handle explosions and such very nice, and the center offers clear speech....again no match for my aperion setup but very good for 190$

at 300+$ i would only have given it 3 stars due to lacking tweeters in the surround speakers, but i give it 4 stars because of the price and is worth every penny.",4.0,3

0.9914,"I was not expecting the headphones to sound as good as they did in comparison to some of the other headphones I have in my collection but these were much better than expected - not only good looks but good sound and comfort

I  listen to music using Cowon players - J3,S9,Iaudio9, Iaudio10, D20, X7
I  normally listen to music using the jet effect option BBE Headphone 3 or a minor custom variation of this
The genre of music is typically blues or blues rock

The other headphones in my collection I compared directly to the revo as a comparison for mobile on the move use are the Sony MDR 1R,  MDR 10R ,  MDR 10Rc , DR 701ip, Sennheiser HD25 II, Momentum, Harman Hardon Cl, Yamaha HPH 200, Philips M1, L1, Citiscape uptown

The result - my personal preference taking into account sound, comfort, price and enjoyment after many hours of listening to music walking or commuting was that this was in my view the revo was only slightly behind the momentum and yamaha and on par with the Harman Kardon for the type of music I listen to in terms of enjoyment, comfort and frequency of use

The pros are the style, build quality , comfort
The cons - The protective dust bag is about as useful as a paper bag for any form of protection

The only thing I did find is that the bass, while well controlled, was sometimes was a bit strong and not as balanced as it could be.",4.0,2
0.9912,"I will add to my review later but I want to get this on the net ASAP TO POTENTIALLY help others
The camera is fantastic and the technology advantage over near competitors is tremendous
This has pan tilt and magic zoom super clear bright excellent audio
Set up can be simple or complicated and this I will update BUT if you read the instructions it is easy
One point of confusion is the initial setup they recommend wired BUT I THOught that meant this is how to set it up though I will be using it with wifi
If that will be your use follow wifi set up
Finally there are 3 apps :  BLUE CLOUD LOGO in apple App Store; Foscam.com us technologies
Free cloud viewing and LOW cost subscriptions
And the camera tools software you download and log into your camera to make settings /alarms / recoding schedule: you can record directly to the 128 GB SD card, and 10 hours a day at the highest resolution should give you about 10 days of continuous 10 hour videos
Lastly the P2P technology in the camera is a significant advantage because this MAC address in the camera is what allows it to be viewable locally in your home and globally on the Internet WITHOUT complicated creation of a local and internet IP address and port forwarding
Do not confuse this issue there is a ton of setup in the 83 page manual you don't need if you just use the phone app the free cloud and the tool software to configure settings
If you wish to use their cloud storage plans they are the lowest starting at 4.99 a month
Ps the viewing angle is 110 degrees and sharp edge no fisheye!",5.0,45
0.9912,"So let's break this down into a much easier to digest Pro/Con List:

Pros:
-100% screen size match for Nikon D5100 camera models
-Super clear & easy to read instructions
-Provided fresh cleaning cloth, instead of making me get mine out of my bag :D
-Ultra clear (It looks like there isn't one on there, I thought I peeled it off at first, but no it's there!)
-Suggested I get a cuppa & muffin, I agree

Cons:
-Super thin, this is only going to protect from light wear & scratches, but you should take better care of your camera if you get more than that honestly :P
-Glossy finish, would be nice to offer glossy OR matte finish for buyers
-Reflective, but not any more or less reflective than my LCD was to begin with

Had to really think on the cons, these arn't cons to me, but things I can see people complaining about.",5.0,8
0.9912,"pros:
- excellent resolution - best of the ultra-compact four megapixel class i've looked at
- 3x optical zoom lens
- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail
- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours
- features ""cerabrite,"" a metal/ceramic mix that is more smudge proof than other materials
- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness
- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)
- the LCD monitor (1.5"") is bright and has an anti-reflective coating - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations
- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting)
- fast shot-to-shot times
- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera
- voice annotation feature
- invervalometer (time lapse capability)
- AF assist lamp works well
- USB connectivity
- good battery life, although i would recommend carrying a spare since canon's batteries are proprietary
- ultracompact: 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 in, weighing only 7.8oz
cons:
- average macro performance
- nine-point AiAF not available in non-auto exposure modes
- average flash performance
- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery compartment
- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom
- very small mode dial
- moderately underexposed flash shots
- very few manual controls - this is okay if all you want is a point and shoot
- RAW format not supported
- the supplied 32MB CF card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for at least a 256MB card
- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare

* 1 x 12V (4+4Pin EPS) (Has 2, but only .25"" apart, must be why it says 4+4, I only needed one)
* 6 x Peripheral  (nice but each cord had 3 close together so you may need an extender for the middle
  one or you can get a SATA adaptor for them to use on newer peripherals)
* 2 x SATA (Both on one cord, 3"" apart, probably would need an extender cable to use 2nd one)

0.991,"even when i play games with all the programs running, this thing runs really smooth, older games ofcourse like C&C Red Alert 3 or Need for speed undercover ( the NFS looks less impressive on this one than on my XPS 14 of course, mainly because of the video card, but nothing that prevents me from occasional playing, a little compromise that i was willing to take to get this awesome look!)
The Solid State Drive is really impressive, though the once 15 seconds is now around 30 because of all the programs installed (i am blaming steam, since booting was much faster before its installation)
So the looks is awesome, the performance is really great for everyday life even with a relatively older core 2 duo processor, the LCD display is really impressive as well as the really quick SSD..if u r looking to spend around a $1000 ( even less if you check the Dell outlet website, u can get a refurb for around $800) for an everyday laptop that looks really different & impressive with almost no compromises on performance then this laptop is for u..",4.0,2
0.9909,"A constant f4 aperture makes this significantly cheaper than the 16-35mm offerings and a also of some use if you run full frame bodies and APS-C ones (17mm is around 27mm on a crop body not ultra wide but still wide) Like all L lenses you do get an included lens hood

A quick hit summary of the stronger and weaker points of the lens

Pros:
+ Excellent build in line with the L badge top quality construction and sealing the lens is robust and built to last
+ Pretty good sharpness esp in the central area, but really needs stopping down full at the 17mm mark (about f11) to tighten the corners up at f8 the extreme corners will have some softening (APS-C users won't see this at all as it's cropped out) very good at f4 at 40mm
+ It's not hugely heavy thanks to the f4 aperture about 480g which is good for a pro grade lens
+ Chromatic aberrations are relatively well controlled they are more pronounced at the widest end and away from the central region but nothing a bit of processing cannot tame by no means a serious issue
+ USM ultra sonic motor is fast and quiet with full time manual focus, the zoom ring is extremely smooth to operate

Cons:
- Some fairly hefty barrel distortion at the 17mm end this drops over the range to very little to none at the 40mm mark, somewhat expected for any ultra wide angle lens and can be corrected via software if required.",4.0,2
0.9909,"PROS:
++ Dedicated top DSLR hammock holds camera with an attached lens in an easily accessible position
++ Top front flap includes memory foam for added protection of your DSLR LCD screen
++ Padded Velcro compartments can be completely customized or removed as necessary to store lenses or other extras
++ Capacity allows for 2-4 extra lenses along with your DSLR camera
++ Padded dividers can be arranged to store your DSLR with a telephoto lens attached
++ Wide-mouth opening makes it easy to fit lenses and extras into the main compartment
++ Padded laptop compartment fits up to a 17 inch widescreen laptop, like a MacBook Pro, or a 15.4 inch standard screen laptop
++ Extra-wide straps can hold a much larger tri-pod than other bags like the Case Logic DSLR sling
++ Plenty of compartments for accessories and other extras
++ Padded back panel has mesh cushions for breathability and comfort
++ Padded straps allow for a comfortable fit
++ Durable and attractive synthetic material stands up well to weather
++ Fabric handle provides another method for easy carrying
++ Water resistant molded EVA base provides shock absorption and extra stability
++ Rectangular shape allows the bag to stand on its own
++ Day holster provides another method for active protection of your camera
++ Holster tether allows for easy attachment to the camera strap
++ Holster includes lens cap pocket so you won't lose your cap on the go

CONS
-- The main compartment zipper leaves a tight fit for getting equipment inside the bottom; storing longer lenses on the bottom will make the best use out of that space
-- No included rain-hood to provide extra protection against harsh weather
-- No integrated waist or chest straps for extra stability
-- Weak fabric handle is less durable than alternatives
-- No loops for hooking things onto with carabiners, rings or straps
-- Plastic zippers and fabric pulls also provide limited options for securing them
-- Accessory pockets are too shallow and only 2 have internal zippered closures
-- Laptop compartment is thinly padded (you can squeeze in an optional sleeve for thin models)
-- Laptop compartment doesn't have enough capacity for oversized models
-- Day holster will only fit a standard lens with your camera (up to 9 inches)
-- Day holster doesn't include a separate strap or molded base for security
-- Comes at a premium compared to alternatives and possibly versus buying components separately
-- No warrantee information was available at the time I received this product

Both components are a good size to accommodate a standard sized DSLR camera with a regular lens attached.",4.0,3

0.9905,"What I loved -
a) The price is so low, these are free
b) They have never run out of charge on me in 3+ months so I don't even know if they run for 6 or 10 hours, really i don't
c) You can talk on the phone on them and the voice clarity (when hearing is good) but others may complain about your voice at times especially when there is ambient sounds filtering into their receiver
d) Good design, they don't look bad and fold up helping in storage
e) The sound quality is worthy of being paid $60 for but you're not even paying half of that
f) You have buttons that rewind the song or skip the song from my iPhone
g) The range is good, I keep these in one part of my gym and am often several meters away and they work like a charm
h) Pairing is easier than anything
i) They don't mind sweat too much and work fine even when I'm running or sweating

- Great Sound, signal processing and many DSP programs
- Many Inputs and many outputs (I only use HDMI and love the fact that this has 2 HDMI outs)
- YPAO works great and really helped me in setting up the system
- Internet Radio works awesome (plenty of channels and easy to navigate UI)
- Love the UI, everything is easy to get to (can be improved thou with more help/details options)
- Pre-amp out, I am not using it but good great to know that i can hoop up external amp for driving high end speakers (will do it in future)
- Iphone & Android apps (both from Yamaha & External developers)
- Secondary zone support which control speakers in another room (can control [even switch on] from iPhone/Android tab's)
- HDMI 'IN' on front (handy for connecting camcorders/tablets etc)
- Runs really cool (no heat issues)
- Network connectivity (DLNA support - works with Tversity)
- Passive Pass-through (My Tivo and PS3 are connected to this receiver and the receiver is then connected to TV but due to 'Passive Pass-through' feature the receiver does not need to be switched on, it will pass the signal even if the receiver is off)
- Price (got a great deal on newe**.***)

Cons:
- Little buttons on remote
- Had to manually configure IP for network connectivity (not a huge issue but some people may feel this intimidating)
- Little issues with Tivo Premiere (Everytime I switch between HD & Non HD channels or use TV guide, TV screen flickers and takes a while to respond (may be 2 seconds) - this could also be a TV issues (4 yr old Panasonic Plasma).",5.0,2

0.9903,"PROS:
- They come on, work nicely, and produce quite a bit of light (I can't say how much, but plenty for my purposes.)
- Built-in barn doors are a great addition
- Easy to adjust power levels (with ""coarse"" and ""fine"" adjustment options, but I never use the ""fine"" option)
- Color gels (4) are a nice value added bonus
- Very light weight, even with the battery (so you can use inexpensive light stands)
- Uses readily available Sony NP-F550 (or similar) style batteries
- Battery level indicator is really helpful

CONS:
- The lights don't come with a battery or power adapter, so you need to buy batteries (generic Sony NP-F550 style)
- Would be nice to have full power adjustment, it only goes from 100% output down to about 40% output (by my visual estimation)

NEUTRAL:
- The lights come with a little 6"" handle, a plastic cold shoe angle attachment, 4 color gels, and a nice cloth bag.",4.0,0

I don't use it as router, I configure it as wireless access point (I have a good old SMC 7004ABR), so far so good, the only thing annoying is it disconnects every time when setting changes takes effect (SMC 2804v2 don't have that problem)
since I don't have super G client card, that I don't use super G, but I found you can't choose any channel under any super G mode (the router seeks them for you, because it uses 2 channels under super G), this is fine for me, because I just use b and g mode, and one more tip: lower channel has better signal

0.9892,"Lives up to its advertisement
- BluTooth connection works well; easy to connect; and works at least from the advertised 30 feet (including between floors);
- Sound is very good with the standard range of listening frequencies; For those that believe that they can hear in the high kilohertz range, I simply can't but I did test the speaker playing an assortment of classical music;  All music that I played sounded very good, but I wouldn't say crisp;  But I should warn you that most of the problems are typically in the compression of the music and not in the speaker itself; This speaker seems to be doing its part in delivering very good audio
- It is yellow (as promised), but I have to say that it looks somewhat like an air freshener;  This could be either good or bad and it is a matter of taste (or lack thereof);  I think that I'd prefer something that was a little less (pardon the pun) loud, but it certainly will blend into your home as well as an air freshener;

Just not sure
- The On/Off switch for the speaker is on the bottom and only turns on after several seconds of assertion;  This in itself is okay, but more critically, it is not something that is easily turned on and off;  In fact, it seems that the BluTooth stays active even after the communicating device has disengaged;  This to me leaves significant room for improvement for two reasons;  First; if you have this in your bedroom, it essentially acts as a night light (not necessarily something that is highly desirable); Second, it seems to have really cut into the battery life of the device;  The unit itself comes with a microUSB to USB cable (so you can recharge it from any source that provides a USB, but the actual play time of the device was probably only 2 - 3 hours rather than the advertised 4;  Of course, you could leave this plugged in and this is a total non-issue, but that is a matter of preference;  It is a lithium batter in the device, but I will monitor this and update the review if initial use of the product is deceptive.",3.0,3

- Kinnect 2.0 Voice commands really work, it is probably a novelty to some, but I find it really useful
- I really like the UI, probably because I have forced myself to adopt window 8.1
- Small Things Count: No more inputing long codes for live membership or preorder codes, it just scans a card with kinect..NICE
- Even with game volume, Kinect still is able to pick out my voice
- I really like the new controller, slight upgrades, but just feels better in your hands
- Ryse is a fun action game, it's pretty basic, but rewarding hack in slash, I am having a lot of fun with it
- Dead Rising 3 is also a lot of fun

Cons:
- This unit is bulky, not sure where I am going to put it in my home theater+ extra space for Kinect
- Not quite ready to be integrated into my home theater yet, until they fix HDMI surround sound issue
- The UI has been 99% perfect so far, but had a small bug with help window, but that's to be expected at launch

0.9891,"ok, so i read review after review about these hp's some say sound isolation some say no isolation, so i went ahead & bought them anyways, let me first say that as i am writing this review i got the headphones on pounding some sexy old skool dance hitz in my head, these hp's are very comfortable, they give a good degree of isolation, sound great & one thing i did not read in other reviews is the fact that these are NOT designed for djing but for iPod, Blackberry & other mp3 players, that's why it comes with an angled mini plug & no 1/4 inch adaptor to fit a dj mixer, wow these are just the bomb plus they're also sexy looking, these hp's give a beautiful full sound when i listen to them in my BB Torch or my 5th gen iPod i got another pair of sony's & for some reason they don't work in my blackberry but they work in my iPod, i think it's cause of the speaker impedance or something, all in all i will definately recommend these sony's to others, & by the way my 17 yr old daughter is already bugging me to buy her a pair, lol.",5.0,2

0.989,"Pros
Bright, really bright image
Contrast is amazing
Colors are good
Set up was easy, compared to previous projector with anamorphic lens

Cons
With lights off - image is too bright, but there is a setting that allows brightness to be dimmed
Fan can be heard during quiet scenes, but not as noticeable as my last projector - I did not notice the buzzing noise mentioned by another reviewer
Set up would have been easier with vertical and horizontal lens shift - I know this would add great expense to the projector so I opted to save $$$

So far, so good.",5.0,86
0.989,"These headphones are really good when it comes to sound reproduction
I am no audiophile but for my hearing capabilities these produce great sound
good deep bass and clear highs
it comes with a pretty long wire which can be handy if you want to connect it to a TV and sit back in your couch
I use it mostly for ipod/laptop so i have kept it tied which is annoyance if you want to take it out
Also the oval shape mean that if your ears are big as mine you may find it a little uncomfortable when using for long periods

Overall it is great sound quality for price and is a great way to enjoy your music/shows without disturbing others",4.0,0
0.9888,"The set is not perfect for everyone, but my justification for this still getting five stars is because it's great for someone like me :)

If you don't read any further, I would say that this is a fantastic set because:
1) the curve of the keys and the 'action' on the keys is really comfortable
2) the detached num pad allows you to ""center"" the keyboard and mouse for much better ergonomics
3) the natural mouse really is quite comfortable and tracks well because of the ""blue track"" technology (will track on reflective surfaces)
4) this is - in spite of all the flaws listed below

I switched from a wired microsoft ergo comfort keyboard + magic mouse/2-button wired USB logitech mouse combination.",5.0,4

The picture quality is great in my opinion (used a Sony Cybershot DSC-W5 to take the pics); it's very easy to use; mp3 files sound pretty good (I didn't expect it to sound that great with those tiny speakers...and it doesn't...not too bad though); so far all the external cards I've plugged in have worked fine (Jump drive, camera memory sticks); didn't have to modify or tweak my pictures at all....they just work and look great on the frame; menu system allows you to adjust/tailor the settings to your liking; the auto slide show feature is fantastic....really works great.",3.0,0

0.9885,"1)  the Jambox (nice for a ""tiny"" device, but not worth the price, should be about $75 instead of $125),
2)  the Big Jambox (sounded good, but somewhat heavy in weight and hollow sounding, and twice the price of the JBL Charge),
3)  Beats by Dre Pill (tinny and no low end worth speaking of and why is this getting good reviews?),
4)  JBL Flip (again, mostly mid to highs with little bottom, except JBL got it right this time with the Charge!),
5)  Logitech UE Mobile Boombox (just OK for its size),

0.9883,"which

 supports this so far and ALL of my digital movies use AC3 audio)

-Sharp, crisp screen with 12 brightness level adjustment

-Recording function works well with high quality video (early

 issues of poor quality video fixed with newer firmware)

-TV out function very handy and simple with just 1 A/V cable

-Astonishing battery life (I consistently return approximately 8

 hours for video and 15 hours for audio at volume level 20/40

 and screen brightness 7/12)

-Well built, leather-like carrying case included

-EXCELLENT technical support with CONSTANT firmware updates

Cons:

-Needs enhanced WMV support

-GUI could be more intuitive, but it's not terrible

-TV recording function could be more intuitive

-Mediocre voice recording

-FM radio useless without headphones/earbuds (act as an antenna)

0.9883,"f/2.6 and f/5.6 at 1x, but nothing in-between (the A540 has in-between values for each zoom)

- Would have been nice to have had a flip-out LCD like the A610

- No Aperture or Shutter Speed priority modes (the A540 does have them)

- LCD screen extremely hard to see in very bright conditions (although to be fair, this seems like a more common issue among digital cameras)

All in all, the Canon A530 is an excellent choice for the price, and might be the best bang for your buck if you're looking for something with more features than your standard point-and-shoot, along with excellent image quality.",4.0,339
